# Project Backend Implementation Report

This document summarizes the successful configuration of a complete, secure, and scalable backend for your Next.js project using Supabase. The architecture is designed to be robust, secure, and easy for your frontend application to interact with.

---

## 1. Core Architecture: Supabase Integrated Auth

- **Primary Authentication:** Handled by Supabase Authentication. This system is responsible for the most critical security tasks: user sign-up, login, password hashing, session management, and JWT (JSON Web Token) generation. This ensures your application is protected by a battle-tested, secure service.

- **Custom Admin Profiles:** Your `public.admins` table acts as a profile table. It is directly linked to the Supabase Auth system and stores custom application-specific data for each user, most importantly, their assigned role. It does not store passwords, as this is handled by Supabase Auth.

- **Automation:** A PostgreSQL Trigger (`on_auth_user_created`) was created to automatically link these two systems. When a new user signs up via Supabase Auth, this trigger instantly creates their corresponding profile in the `admins` table with a default role.

---

## 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

A granular permission system has been established using three distinct administrative roles, defined in a custom `admin_role` type to ensure data integrity:

- **super_admin:** The highest level of access. This role can manage all content (blogs, projects), all messages, site configuration, and—most importantly—can manage other admin users.
- **content_manager:** The primary role for day-to-day content operations. This role has full create, read, update, and delete permissions for `blog_posts`, `projects`, and `project_images`. They cannot access messages or site configuration.
- **messages_manager:** A specialized role with permission to view, manage, and delete user-submitted messages. They cannot access content or site configuration.

---

## 3. Database Schema Overview

The following tables have been configured in your Supabase database (see `/supabase/migrations/00001_init.sql` for complete schema):

### Tables
- **admins**
  - Primary profile table for authenticated users
  - Fields: id, email, password, name, role, failed_attempts, locked_until, last_login, last_password_change, created_at
  - Indexed on: email

- **blog_posts**
  - Blog article storage with drafts and publishing system
  - Fields: id, title, slug, excerpt, content, category, status, share_on_social, views, image, created_at, updated_at, published_at
  - Indexed on: slug, status, category, created_at, published_at

- **messages**
  - Contact form and user message storage
  - Fields: id, first_name, last_name, email, phone, message, type, status, created_at
  - Indexed on: status, created_at

- **projects**
  - Portfolio project information with rich content support
  - Fields: id, slug, title, excerpt, image, categories (JSONB), start_date, location, people_helped, status, content (JSONB), goals (JSONB), created_at, updated_at
  - Indexed on: slug, status, created_at, (created_at, id), (status, created_at)

- **project_images**
  - Gallery images for projects with alt text support
  - Fields: id, project_id, image_url, alt_text, created_at
  - Foreign key: project_id references projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
  - Indexed on: project_id

- **site_config**
  - Global site configuration storage
  - Fields: id, logo_url, created_at, updated_at

### Custom Types
- `admin_role`: ENUM ('super_admin', 'content_manager', 'messages_manager')

### Security Highlights
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- JWT-based role extraction via `get_my_role()` function
- Granular policies for each table:
  - Public read access for blogs, projects, images, and site config
  - Content managers can manage blogs and projects
  - Message managers can handle contact form submissions
  - Super admins have full access across all tables
  - Users can only edit their own admin profile unless they're super_admin

### Performance Optimization
- Strategic indexes on frequently queried columns
- Composite indexes for common query patterns
- JSONB support for flexible content storage
- Timestamptz used for all temporal data

## 4. Security Implementation: Row Level Security (RLS)

The entire database is protected by PostgreSQL's Row Level Security, which acts as a powerful, always-on firewall for your data.

- **RLS is Enabled on All Tables:** No data can be accessed unless a policy explicitly allows it.
- **JWT-Based Policies:** Security policies are intelligently designed to inspect the JWT of the logged-in user. The user's role, which is automatically injected into their JWT by our trigger function, is used to grant or deny access.

**Policy Highlights:**

- Anonymous visitors can only read public content (blogs, projects).
- Logged-in admins can only perform actions (create, update, delete) strictly permitted by their role. For example, a `content_manager` will be automatically blocked by the database if they attempt to read from the `messages` table.

---

## 5. File & Media Storage

Three dedicated storage buckets have been created and secured with policies that mirror the database's role-based permissions:

- `projects`: Publicly readable. Writable only by `super_admin` and `content_manager`.
- `blogs`: Publicly readable. Writable only by `super_admin` and `content_manager`.
- `Assalam`: Publicly readable. Writable only by `super_admin` for managing critical site assets like logos.

## 6. Supabase Integration in Next.js

### Environment Variables
- `.env.example` created with all required Supabase keys. `.env.local` is git-ignored for security.

### Supabase Client Libraries
- `lib/supabaseClient.js` and `lib/supabaseServer.js` for client/server usage.
- `utils/supabase/client.js`, `utils/supabase/server.js`, and `utils/supabase/middleware.js` for modular, role-aware integration.

### Dependency Management
- `@supabase/supabase-js` added to `package.json` and installed.

### .gitignore
- Updated to allow `.env.example` but ignore all local/private env files.

---

## 7. Admin Authentication Flow

### Login Page
- `app/admin/login.js` as a client component for admin login.
- Uses Supabase client to sign in with email and password.
- On successful login, redirects to `/admin/dashboard`.

### Admin Dashboard (Protected Route)
- `app/admin/dashboard/page.js` as a server component.
- Reads the access token from cookies, decodes the JWT, and checks the user's role.
- Only allows access if the role is `super_admin` or `content_manager`.
- Redirects to login if not authenticated or not an admin.

### JWT Role Extraction
- Uses the `jose` library's `decodeJwt` to extract the role from the user's JWT.
- Role is displayed on the dashboard for confirmation.

## 8. Security and Usage Summary

You now have a production-grade backend with a clear separation of concerns. The system automatically manages user profiles and injects their permissions into their session token. Your database and file storage will now enforce these permissions on every single request, ensuring that your data is secure by default.

### Next.js Usage Notes
- Use the standard Supabase client library (`@supabase/ssr` or `@supabase/supabase-js`) to handle user login (`supabase.auth.signInWithPassword`).
- Once a user is logged in, you can retrieve their role from the session object: `session.user.user_metadata.role`.
- All subsequent API calls and data queries made with the Supabase client will be automatically and securely filtered by the RLS policies you have activated. You do not need to manually add WHERE clauses for security in your queries.

## 9. Integration Tests

### Test Implementation
Created two test components to verify the Supabase integration:

1. **API Route** (`/app/api/test/route.js`)
   - Validates environment variables
   - Tests Supabase client initialization
   - Verifies JWT token extraction and role access
   - Performs a test database query
   - Returns comprehensive test results

2. **Test Page** (`/app/test/page.js`)
   - Client-side component to display test results
   - Shows environment check status
   - Displays current authentication state
   - Shows JWT token validation results
   - Reports database connectivity status
   - Updates in real-time as tests complete
